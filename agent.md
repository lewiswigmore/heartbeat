# Agent Guidelines

## Commits
- Keep messages short and clear
- Use present tense: "Fix auth", "Add feature", "Update docs"
- No emoji, no fluff, no "chore:" prefixes unless necessary

## Dev
- Read existing code first to understand patterns
- Make minimal changes that work
- Test locally before pushing
- Don't break existing functionality
- Use existing dependencies when possible

## Code Style
- Simple and readable
- Minimal comments - code should be self-explanatory
- No over-engineering
- Follow project conventions

## General
- Fix the problem, don't over explain.
- Less is more
- Ask for clarification if requirements are unclear
