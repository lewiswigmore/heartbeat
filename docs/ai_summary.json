  "text": "The zero-trust image-annotator service continuously monitors and manages annotator configuration, enforcing signed, least-privilege policies and blocking unverified changes. It secures devtools workflows by providing tamper-evident configs, automated drift remediation, and auditable policy enforcement.",
  "examples": [
    "Action 1: Bootstrap the zero-trust image-annotator service with a signed config manifest (config/annotator.policy.json) and enable immutable, read-only mounts for the annotator runtime.",
    "Action 2: Configure the zero-trust image-annotator service to watch annotator.yaml and registry credentials, rejecting unsigned diffs and auto-rolling back on drift.",
    "Action 3: Integrate the zero-trust image-annotator service into CI via OIDC so it issues time-bound, least-privilege tokens to run annotate jobs only after policy attestation passes."
