  "text": "A realtime secrets-rotator daemon continuously watches configuration files and secret backends, atomically rotating credentials and hot-reloading dependent services. This minimizes secret exposure windows, enforces rotation policies, and reduces downtime and manual toil.",
  "examples": [
    "Action 1: Configure the realtime secrets-rotator daemon to watch /etc/myapp/secrets.json, rotate AWS access keys every 12 hours, write updates via atomic file swap, and SIGHUP the myapp service for zero-downtime reload",
    "Action 2: Integrate the realtime secrets-rotator daemon with HashiCorp Vault to lease PostgreSQL credentials, update the app's ConfigMap and Kubernetes Secret, and trigger a rolling pod restart only if hot-reload is unavailable",
    "Action 3: Deploy the realtime secrets-rotator daemon as a systemd service with least-privilege IAM credentials, emitting Prometheus metrics and alerting to Slack on rotation failures or stale secrets beyond policy"
