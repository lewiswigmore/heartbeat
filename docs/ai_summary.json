    "Deploy the graph-based metrics virtual-machine via Terraform, mount /data for message storage, and connect IMAP/SMTP credentials to auto-ingest and normalize emails.",
    "Configure the graph-based metrics virtual-machine to generate a senderâ€“recipient communication graph and compute PageRank, betweenness centrality, and community labels on an hourly cron job.",
    "Set up the graph-based metrics virtual-machine to emit webhook alerts when graph anomaly scores exceed a threshold and export daily metrics to S3 and Prometheus for dashboards."
