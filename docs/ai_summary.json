  "text": "An extension that classifies and manages API responses using semantic feature flags, enabling automated, intent-aware toggling and routing. It reduces manual rule maintenance by interpreting response meaning and applying consistent feature controls across services.",
  "examples": [
    "Action 1: Configure the semantic feature-flags extension to classify API responses into intents (e.g., 'pricing', 'auth_error') and automatically toggle flags that route requests to the appropriate service version.",
    "Action 2: Attach the semantic feature-flags extension middleware to your API client to enable the 'recommendations' flag when response entities include 'product' and 'in_stock' attributes.",
    "Action 3: Define rollout rules in the semantic feature-flags extension to gate the 'smart_retry' feature when response sentiment is negative and latency exceeds 500ms."
