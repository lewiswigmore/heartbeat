  "text": "A productivity-focused watch app that models your habits and metrics as a fuzzy symbol-graph, enabling on-wrist back-testing of performance-counters to optimize routines and goals. It helps you visualize uncertain relationships between activities and outcomes so you can refine behaviors in real time.",
  "examples": [
    "Action 1: Back-test the last 14 days of your 'Deep Work' routine by replaying performance-counters across the fuzzy symbol-graph watch-app and comparing node membership trends to your baseline.",
    "Action 2: Add a 'Focus' symbol node with fuzzy weights for energy and interruptions, then configure the fuzzy symbol-graph watch-app to auto-adjust daily targets when the edge confidence drops below 0.6.",
    "Action 3: Pin the 'Hydration' node as a complication in the fuzzy symbol-graph watch-app and trigger a haptic alert when its counter deviates by 20% from the expected path during a work session."
