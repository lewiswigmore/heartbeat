  "text": "The fuzzy service-mesh library ingests and transcodes Terraform state into a mesh-aware model, applying fuzzy matching to relate infrastructure resources to services for better observability. This enables teams to correlate state changes with mesh telemetry, detect drift, and understand topology and SLO impacts in near real time.",
  "examples": [
    "Use the fuzzy service-mesh library to transcode an existing Terraform .tfstate into a fuzzy service graph and export OpenTelemetry spans and metrics for each mesh workload and edge.",
    "Configure the fuzzy service-mesh library to reconcile Terraform state drift into service-mesh policies (timeouts, retries, circuit breakers) by applying fuzzy selectors on service labels and annotations.",
    "Integrate the fuzzy service-mesh library into a canary rollout to tag mesh routes with SLO metadata and emit anomaly alerts when Terraform-applied changes alter traffic distribution beyond fuzzy-defined thresholds."
