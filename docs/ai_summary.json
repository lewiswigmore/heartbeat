  "text": "The federated scheduler daemon classifies and manages scheduler-related log files across multiple clusters, providing centralized visibility and policy-driven handling. It adds value by unifying log ingestion, categorization, retention, and alerting for distributed scheduling environments.",
  "examples": [
    "Deploy the federated scheduler daemon across all clusters to collect scheduler logs and forward them to a centralized data lake with daily rotation and compression.",
    "Configure the federated scheduler daemon to classify logs by tenant, queue, and job ID, then route anomaly-tagged entries to a Kafka topic for real-time alerts.",
    "Set up the federated scheduler daemon with retention policies (e.g., 90 days), automatic PII redaction, and a Prometheus endpoint exposing ingestion, error, and classification metrics."
