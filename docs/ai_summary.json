  "text": "A webapp that spins up and manages terminal sessions to run temporal audio-transcribe pipelines, producing time-aligned transcripts with built-in observability of logs, metrics, and traces. It centralizes execution, monitoring, and artifact management so teams can reliably operate and audit transcription workflows.",
  "examples": [
    "Create a new managed terminal session in the temporal audio-transcribe webapp, upload an MP3, and run a time-aligned transcription job that streams word-level timestamps to the session console and saves SRT/VTT artifacts.",
    "Enable observability in the temporal audio-transcribe webapp by attaching OpenTelemetry to the session, then view real-time logs, traces, and CPU/memory metrics for the running transcription pipeline.",
    "Schedule a recurring temporal audio-transcribe webapp workflow that spins up a terminal session nightly, pulls audio from S3, transcribes with diarization, and posts a summary plus transcript links to Slack."
