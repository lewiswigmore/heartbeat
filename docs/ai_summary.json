    "Configure the temporal image-annotator service to ingest browser history events and attach time-synced image annotations, storing them with a 30-day retention policy",
    "Enable OpenTelemetry tracing in the temporal image-annotator service to emit spans for annotation creation, edits, and replay, correlated to browser history timestamps",
    "Schedule a nightly job in the temporal image-annotator service to export per-user, time-sliced annotation timelines to S3 and trigger a webhook when anomalies are detected"
