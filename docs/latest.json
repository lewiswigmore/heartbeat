      "Action 1: Use the streaming graphql-gateway cli to subscribe to email events (messageQueued, messageDelivered) via the graphql-gateway, simulate an inbound email, and stream live GraphQL subscription payloads while exporting OpenTelemetry traces.",
      "Action 2: Run the streaming graphql-gateway cli to health-check the graphql-gateway, enable request/response logging, and continuously stream aggregated latency and error metrics to your observability backend.",
      "Action 3: Replay a batch of 1,000 synthetic emails through the graphql-gateway with the streaming graphql-gateway cli, capture end-to-end delivery latency percentiles, and emit a performance report with alerts when SLO thresholds are exceeded."
