    "text": "The fuzzy observability sdk normalizes and manages terminal sessions, capturing imprecise signals (commands, prompts, timings, exit states) and turning them into queryable fuzzy telemetry for faster troubleshooting and trend analysis. It unifies disparate shell behaviors and correlates noisy session data into actionable insights.",
    "examples": [
      "Action 1: Install and initialize the fuzzy observability sdk to wrap Bash/Zsh terminal sessions and enable normalization of prompts, timestamps, and exit codes.",
      "Action 2: Configure fuzzy match rules in the fuzzy observability sdk to convert semi-structured command outputs into fuzzy spans and metrics, and export them to your observability backend.",
      "Action 3: Integrate the fuzzy observability sdk into CI runners to stream anonymized session telemetry and query the fuzzy session index for anomalous workflows and flaky steps."
