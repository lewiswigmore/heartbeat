    "examples": [
      "Action 1: Deploy the ambient audio-transcribe container-image with ENV MODEL_A=whisper-large-v3 and MODEL_B=deepspeech, auto-transcode incoming WAV to FLAC, and persist A/B-test-results to a mounted /data/ab-results volume.",
      "Action 2: Run the ambient audio-transcribe container-image on Kubernetes using two ConfigMaps for noise_suppression=A and noise_suppression=B, then export A/B-test-results as JSON to S3 and publish latency/WER metrics to Prometheus.",
      "Action 3: Use the ambient audio-transcribe container-image CLI to transcode a batch of MP3 files, run parallel transcriptions for variant A and B, and schedule a cron job that aggregates A/B-test-results into a dashboard-ready CSV."
