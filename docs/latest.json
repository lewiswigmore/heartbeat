    "text": "A background daemon that ingests GitHub issues, normalizes metadata (timestamps, labels, assignees), and generates time-aware recommendations for triage and prioritization. It helps dev teams act on temporal signals like staleness, bursts, and SLAs to schedule the next best action.",
    "examples": [
      "Action 1: Install and configure the temporal recommendations daemon to normalize GitHub issue timestamps, labels, and assignees, and set a 15-minute polling cadence.",
      "Action 2: Define temporal recommendation rules in the temporal recommendations daemon (e.g., escalate bugs idle >48h, ping reviewers on PRs inactive >24h, auto-close discussions after 30d of no activity).",
      "Action 3: Integrate the temporal recommendations daemon with your triage workflow to post prioritized, time-aware suggestions as GitHub comments and labels."
