    "text": "A devtools-focused webapp that visualizes and manages PDFs while synchronizing them with audio transcripts, optimized for quantum-related content. It enables developers and researchers to align, search, and annotate transcripts against PDF sections via API, CLI, and real-time views.",
    "examples": [
      "Upload a quantum research PDF and lecture audio to the quantum audio-transcribe webapp, auto-align transcript timestamps to PDF headings, and render a side-by-side waveform/PDF viewer with clickable segments.",
      "Use the quantum audio-transcribe webapp API to stream audio for real-time transcription, auto-tag quantum terms (e.g., qubit, entanglement), and write annotations back into the managed PDF via PATCH /pdfs/{id}/annotations.",
      "Add a CI step that invokes the quantum audio-transcribe webapp CLI to batch transcribe new audio assets, update linked PDFs, and export a summarized JSON index for search and retrieval."
