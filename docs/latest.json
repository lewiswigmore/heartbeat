    "text": "A command-line tool that embeds and manages performance counters across ML pipelines while emitting stateless data-lineage events, enabling reproducible tracking without persistent state. It lets teams trace dataset/model transformations and benchmark runs end-to-end with minimal overhead.",
    "examples": [
      "Action 1: Use the stateless data-lineage cli to embed performance-counters (latency, throughput, GPU-util) into a training job and tag them with a run-id and model-version.",
      "Action 2: Emit stateless lineage events for each dataset→feature→model transformation step and route them to a collector using the stateless data-lineage cli.",
      "Action 3: Export a lineage graph and counter summary for a specific run by aggregating emitted events with the stateless data-lineage cli and write the report to JSON for CI artifacts."
